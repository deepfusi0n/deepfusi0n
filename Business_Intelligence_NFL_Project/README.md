# Business Intelligence NFL Project 🏈

This project was completed as part of my Business Intelligence coursework and focuses on predicting college football outcomes using data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling in R. 

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that influence wins and losses in college football.  
- **Dataset:** 36 variables from Kaggle, covering offensive, defensive, and penalty statistics.  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Data cleaning and transformation (Excel & R)  
  - Exploratory visualizations (bar charts, distributions)  
  - Multiple regression models for predicting wins and losses  

---

## 🧹 Key Insights
- **Passing Touchdowns** are the most significant factor in predicting wins (1 extra passing TD increased win probability by ~14.9%).  
- **Penalties** were the strongest predictor of losses (1 extra penalty increased loss probability by ~12.2%).  
- Western Kentucky led the 2021 season with **6,072 passing yards**.  
- Turnovers were symmetrically distributed across teams with an average of **17.3 per season**.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills
- **R (tidyverse, ggplot2, regression modeling)**  
- **Excel (data cleaning, preprocessing)**  
- **Business Intelligence workflows** (data visualization, predictive modeling, ETL concepts)

## 🎯 Relevance
This project demonstrates end-to-end BI and analytics skills:
1. Cleaning messy, real-world data.  
2. Building and validating regression models.  
3. Extracting insights to inform strategy and decision-making.  

Even though this was an academic project, the approach mirrors real-world data science pipelines where **quality data engineering and modeling drive actionable insights**.
