# Hi, I’m Joshua 👋

I’m a data-driven problem solver with experience in **Python, R, SQL, and cloud technologies (AWS, Oracle)**.  
I love using technology to turn raw data into meaningful insights, whether through machine learning, automation, or creative analysis.

Currently, I’m focused on:
- Building my technical portfolio through applied **Python and R projects**.  
- Expanding into **API development and integration**.  
- Exploring **cloud computing** (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner).  
- Preparing for early-career opportunities in **data, analytics, and software engineering**.
