# AWS Academy Cloud Foundations â€” Labs

Hands-on notes and artifacts from my AWS Academy Cloud Foundations coursework, which prepared me for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. These labs gave me practical, in-depth experience with AWS services.

- **VPC & Networking:** Built a VPC, created subnets, configured routing and security groups.
- **Compute:** Launched EC2 instances, built Lambda functions, deployed containers with ECS/Fargate.
- **Storage:** Worked with S3 buckets and policies, managed EBS volumes.
- **Databases:** Created RDS instances and experimented with DynamoDB.
- **Monitoring & IaC:** Used CloudWatch for metrics/alarms and CloudFormation for resource templates.

## What I Practiced
- Launching and connecting to EC2 instances.
- Creating and securing S3 buckets.
- Writing and testing Lambda functions.
- Applying IAM roles and policies.
- Monitoring and setting alarms in CloudWatch.
- Automating deployments with CloudFormation.
